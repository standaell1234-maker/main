Generic constraints with methods have incorrect zero value and method resolution.
Type constraints on generics that include methods are handled as interfaces,
which leads to incorrect behavior when the underlying type is a primitive.
The zero value becomes null instead of the correct zero value for the type
(e.g., 0 for int-based types, "" for string-based types).
