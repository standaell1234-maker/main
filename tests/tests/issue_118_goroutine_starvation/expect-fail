Goroutine loops can starve other goroutines.
GoScript uses async/await for concurrency, which is cooperative multitasking.
A tight loop in a goroutine without await points (channel operations, etc.)
will block the JavaScript event loop and prevent other goroutines from running.

This test would likely HANG or TIMEOUT in GoScript because worker1's tight
loop never yields control, starving worker2.
